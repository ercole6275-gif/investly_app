This is a minimal Flutter demo project for **Investly**. It's designed for beta testing flows and UI:
- Onboarding (simple)

- Portfolios (list)
- Goals / Objectives
- Brokers list (links)

**How to run (after cloning on your PC with Flutter installed):**
1. `flutter pub get`
2. `flutter run -d chrome`  # for web demo or
3. `flutter run`            # for emulator / device
4. `flutter build apk --release`  # to generate APK

This repo is a demo (no real backend). Use for beta testing the UI and flows.
